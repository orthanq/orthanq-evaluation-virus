Best solution according to the best odds score. The top barchart displays the sum of fractions with bars for each predicted haplotype that is explained by the corresponding variant, circles represent observed variant allele frequency. Second and third dotplots represent genotype and coverage matrices, with the former referring to whether the haplotype contains the variant or not while the latter referring to whether the variant region is covered by the lineage or not. The last plot shows the allele frequency distribution of each variant with probabilities obtained from Varlociraptor.
