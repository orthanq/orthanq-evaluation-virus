A stacked barchart for SARS-CoV-2 variant predictions for Orthanq, Kallisto, Pangolin and Nextclade for
two studies that include 13 samples with co-infection by Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-
CoV-2. Red color tones refer to 'Omicron', 'purple' to 'Delta', green to 'recombinant' and gray to
other lineages (Error margins of the samples from PRJNA809680 are given as SRR18113107:
Omicron: 56.1% ± 32.3%, Delta: 57.5% ± 36.6%; SRR18113108: Omicron: 100%, Delta: 0%;
SRR18113109: Omicron: 17.9%± 5.2%, Delta: 81.8%± 6.1%; SRR18113110: Omicron: 4.1%
± 3.0%, Delta:94.1% ± 3.7%; SRR18113111: Omicron: 20.2% ± 13.3%, Delta: 72.3% ± 12.5%;
