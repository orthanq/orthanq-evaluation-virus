This report presents results of the paper "Virus variant quantification with Orthanq". Orthanq is a tool for uncertainty-aware haplotype quantification that is based on a Bayesian latent variable model. One application of Orthanq, HLA typing, has been shown before_. This work explores another application of Orthanq, virus variant quantification. It compares Orthanqs predictions for simulated and real SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 virus mixture datasets. This study compares these predictions with state of the art tools such as Pangolin_, Nextclade_ and Kallisto_.
